There is more than one way to bold text in CSS.

How to do this can depend on how you're updating your web page.

If one doens't work for you, try one of the other methods.

If none of them work for you take a look at our troubleshooting section below.

## How to bold text in CSS

The bold font look is accomplished with a CSS property called `font-weight`.

Using something called inline styles or inline CSS we can write the font-weight CSS property direction into the HTML.

All CSS properties are coded into the "style" attribute when you want to write inline CSS.

The style attribute is available on all HTML elements.

For example, let's say you have an existing sentence within an HTML `<p>` tag or paragraph tag.

`<p>I want all you dogs to BARK together!.</p>`

The 'BARK' in all capitilized letters looks good but we want even more emphasis with a bold font-weight.

`<p>I want all you dogs to <span style="font-weight: bold;">BARK</span> together!.</p>`

## How to bold text from a stylesheet

If you have access to the entire HTML document, or have your styles in a stylesheet, you can write your CSS rule outside of the element tag.

Use a CSS selector and simply add the `font-weight` property with a value.

```
p {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

This CSS rule will make ALL the HTML paragraph tags aka text within these `<p>Hello, </p>` the next highest weight your font has.

A CSS rule like that would go into your CSS stylesheet (without the `<style>` tags) or on the `.html` page itself.

If this is a little too much, you might be able to shortcut this process with HTML.

## How to bold text with HTML

In HTML there are two built in elements that generally bold text automatically if wrap the text in them: `<b>` and `<strong>`.

Those elements will usually go inside of other elements, like a paragraph tag. In practice it would look something like this:

`<p>We'll see <b>you</b> on the other side!</p>`

## How font-weight works

`font-weight` accepts two types of values: numerical and text.

Numerical is 100 to 900 in range, that increases by 100 each time.

- ie `100`, `200`, `300`, `400`, `500`, `600`, `700`, `800`, `900`

Text is just words and it might be easier to remember since it's relative to whatever "regular" is.

So if you wanted to make text bold, you would use `bold`, but if you wanted it bolder, you guessed it, you would use `bolder`.

- Font Weight Text Values: `lighter`, `normal`, `bold`, `bolder`

How to bold specific text in CSS

## 3 Ways to Make Text Bold with CSS

CSS font weight can be implemented in three different ways:

- Inline
- Stylesheet
- Style Tag

You don't need to put your CSS in all three, just select one that makes the most sense to your project.

Where it makes sense is based on what you have access to and where your existing CSS code is already written.

It's a best practice to follow what your website is already doing

## CSS font-weight isn't working

1. You're trying to bold a header element that is already bold.
2. Check your stylesheets for overwritten `<b>` or `<strong>` rules.
3. Ensure your font has a bold font-weight available or included.

### 1. Your text is in a header element is already bold

I've definitely done this one before.

If you're trying to bold text within a HTML header element, like `<h1>` or `<h2>` that element might already be at its highest font-weight.

For example:

`<h1>Best show <strong>ever</strong>!</h1>`

The default font-weight on `<strong>` may be the same or lower than that of the `<h1>`.

If you lower the font-weight on your header element, and the font-weight is higher on your `<b>`/`<strong>` elements, then you should get the affect you're looking for.

### 2. Check if your CSS is overwriting &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;b&gt;

Sometimes websites include something called a "reset" which ensures that all styles on website are set to standard or no styles whatsoever as to not make assumptions or conflict with the coders intentions.

Sometimes `<bold>` and `<strong>` have the default bold font-weights removed in the stylesheet so when you use them in HTML it appears as though they aren't working.

You can add in those styles yourself in case they are missing, or look for CSS rules that would remove that font-weight.

Remember! A website can have more than 1 stylesheet, so check your entire site for more stylesheets if this issue persists.

### 3. Is your font-weight included with your font?

If you bold text isn't showing up as expected, make sure that whatever font you're using supports a heavier weight that bold font.

Not all font-weights have an increased weight for each of the 100-900 weights.

Google Fonts is commonly used for websites looking to have a unique font.

That font, and ALL of it's variations need to be loaded if you want to use them all.

When you initially setup your Google font, you need specifically select all the weights that you want to use.

Google Fonts doesn't assume you want to use all of them.

Using all the fonts can add a lot of page weight aka load time and slow your page down.

This is a acceptable trade-off if you're using all the font weights.

Most page designs don't though. Most websites use 3-4 font-weights.

It's a best practice to only load the font variations that you will be using.
