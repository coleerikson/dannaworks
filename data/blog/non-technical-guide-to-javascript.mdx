Javascript is a programming language created specifically for the web.

Where [HTML](./non-technical-guide-to-html) and [CSS](./non-technical-guide-to-css) are both markup languages that help give meaning to specific content on a webpage, Javascript is a formal programming language that allows you to do the dynamic tasks we've come to expect from modern websites.

## What does Javascript do?

Javascript is behind everything dynamic behind a webpage. It's hard to tell by just looking at a webpage where Javascript might be used but think of things like:

- A modal dropping down
- Clicking something to reveal information
- Additional content loading on click or scroll
- Tags over an image
- A menu dropping down
- Almost all animations (sliding, bouncing, rotating)
- Filtering information without a page reload
