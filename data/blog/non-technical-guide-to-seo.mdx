When you use a search engine, like Google or Bing, to find something you're looking for you get a list of websites that the search engine believes will help you get the thing you're looking for.

File this under **things we already know**.

Question to you though...

_How many times have you not found what you were looking for on the first page of results to your query?_

Another question...

_How many times have you not found what you were looking for in top 3 results?_

Not many times I imagine. Me either. We can conclude together on this mutual lived experience that it is very important for a website to be on the first page of search results if they want their website to be found by anyone.

The practice of getting on the first page, and better yet top 3, of results for any given keyword or phrase is Search Engine Optimization or SEO.

## Why does SEO matter?

Imagine you own a shoe store.

And any time someone uses Google to search for "**[Your Town]** shoe store" or "**[Your State]** shoe store" your website appears first in the search results.

Do you think you would get a lot of customers?

**Answer: Yes, yes you would.**

You would be one of those rich people I hear so much about.

Now think of all the different products and services that exist, and the potential of being the first result when someone searches for that information.

I can't overstate the importance of being ranked for certain keywords.

It can be a make or break element of any business online.
