Git is software that tracks changes within files. It can be used for tracking many types of changes within files but it's most commonly used in the programming world.

I'll be referring to Git while as I write because it is the most popular version control system today but there are many others. The benefits and general functionality of Git are the same across most version control systems. I'll be using them interchangibly.

## What is the purpose of Git?

Git is a fundamental tool to track work and collaborate on a project.

If you're working alone on a project, you can use git to save your work as you go. Thinking of it like saving during a video game. You can stop where you are, save your progress just in case this go poorly in the future, and continue on your journey knowing you can always go back to where you were easily.

Or, since this is a "non-technical" guide, think of version control like a hike through the woods but while you're walking you have a ball of string that you let out while you walk. This way you always know how to get back to where you were. And to continue this metaphor anyone who finds your string can follow it as well to see where you went but also how you go there.

## Why does Git version control matter to you?

Anyone working on a piece of software should understand the basic features and flow of Git. It will help anyone near the product understand at what state a particular feature is at.

Understanding that flow of development work and speaking to it will make you sound knowledgeable and allow you to facilitate pushing your work forward.

## Git terms in the office

- "Did you commit that?"
