Very Small Problems is a guide and glossary to the often confusing and ever evolving world of web and mobile development.

My goal is to answer questions like:

- What are the basics of HTML and CSS?
- What is Github and how does it work?
- Why are 2 week sprints the most common?

I'm going to begin with guides that explain web development the way I wish someone would explained it to me when I started programming; in a clear and coherant narrative that fits all these seemingly disparat technologies together.

Cheers!
